## Tableau Visualisation for the Bandcamp Dance Librarian project

This repository contains a timeline animation created in Tableau for the Bandcamp Dance Librarian project (`timeline.mp4`) with some track examples (`trackexamples.pdf`). This geographic visualisation is auxiliary to the Classifying Techno Cities case study presented in the article Dance Librarian: Sonic Explorations of the Bandcamp Underground (https://dx.doi.org/10.12801/1947-5403.2021.13.01.11).

### Short Description

Based on audio feature analysis, four stylistic clusters are identified within a selection of 6713 tracks from the Bandcamp libraries of 38 underground techno labels. The numbers on the map indicate the number of tracks arriving from each country, while the pie charts show the distribution of the stylistic clusters in each city. The datasets are provided in `labels.csv` (the list of music labels including their home city and country) and `tracks.csv` (the list of tracks with their algorithmically identified clusters, their distance from the cluster center, and additional details).

## Power BI Report

This repository also contains a Power BI report created for the same case study (`bandcamp-lib-visual.pbix`).

The report is available online at [http://bclibvisual.vitos.tv/](http://bclibvisual.vitos.tv/).
